### Inspiration
Inspired by the recent controversy with TLauncher, we wanted to do our bit by making an optimal and quite nice launcher that users feel comfortable to use on a daily basis, giving them also the ability to give it their own identity along with the themes, as well as adding features that seem interesting, always with the priority of listening to the opinions of the community.

### TODO
- [ ] Fix Light Theme :V
- [ ] Customized system for each theme-based widget
- [ ] Download Java when download version (and store as param of instance)
- [ ] Correct Launch instance ([issue](https://github.com/SergioRibera/openmc_lite/issues/2))
- [ ] Add Microsoft and Mojang login
